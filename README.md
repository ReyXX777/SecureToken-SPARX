Features
Tokenization and Detokenization:

Converts sensitive data into unique tokens.

Retrieves original data when needed, ensuring data security and usability.

Encryption:

Adds an extra layer of security by encrypting tokens.

Utilizes advanced encryption algorithms to protect data.

Batch Processing:

Supports bulk tokenization and detokenization.

Efficiently handles large volumes of data.

Integration APIs:

Easy-to-use RESTful APIs for tokenizing and detokenizing data.

Supports GraphQL for flexible queries.

Provides SDKs and client libraries in multiple programming languages.

Implements API authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.

Audit Logs:

Keeps detailed logs of all tokenization and detokenization activities.

Enhances compliance and monitoring.

Data Masking:

Masks sensitive data in real-time, showing only partial information.

Useful for displaying data securely, such as the last four digits of a credit card.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Ensures only authorized users can access or manage tokenized data.

Enhances security through granular access control.

High Availability and Scalability:

Ensures the system is robust and can handle large volumes of data.

Designed to scale horizontally as needed.

Compliance Management:

Supports compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

Ensures data security and privacy standards are met.

Multi-Tenancy:

Supports multiple clients with isolated data storage and management.

Enables secure and efficient handling of client data.

Real-Time Alerts:

Notifies admins of any suspicious activities or potential breaches.

Enhances security through proactive monitoring.

Performance Monitoring:

Tracks system performance metrics.

Ensures optimal operation and quick resolution of issues.

Token Vault Features
Secure Storage:

Utilizes encryption to securely store the mapping between tokens and original data.

Implements robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access.

Access Control:

Uses role-based access control (RBAC) to manage access to the vault.

Ensures only authorized personnel can access sensitive data.

Token Expiry:

Supports configurable token expiration policies.

Automatically invalidates tokens after a certain period.

Data Anonymization:

Provides options for anonymizing original data.

Ensures privacy and compliance with data protection regulations.

Redundancy and Backup:

Ensures data is replicated across multiple locations.

Regularly backs up data to prevent loss.

Audit Trails:

Maintains detailed logs of all access and modification activities.

Enhances compliance and monitoring.

Versioning:

Keeps track of different versions of the stored data.

Supports rollback and recovery.

Integration APIs Features
RESTful Endpoints:

Provides easy-to-use RESTful endpoints for tokenizing and detokenizing data.

Supports integration with various systems and applications.

API Authentication and Authorization:

Implements OAuth 2.0 or API keys for secure access.

Ensures only authorized clients can use the APIs.

Detailed Documentation:

Provides comprehensive API documentation.

Includes usage examples and best practices.
